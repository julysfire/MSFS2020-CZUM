##### Description
CZUM - Churchill Falls Airport, Churchill Falls, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada

Cords: 53°33'40.0"N 64°05'51.5"W

##### Summary

Churchill Falls Airport is located near Churchill Falls in the beautiful Newfoundland and Labrador in Canada.  A small airport with no formal terminal is home to a few hangars and a beautiful area landscape filled with lush forests, flowing rivers, valleys, hills, and the Churchill Falls waterfall.  I encourage you to fly some VFR around this area and enjoy the beauty that nature has offered here.

## TODO

1. Look into 3D modeling the actual Falls, I think it would look much nicer
2. 3D model the other hangar
3. Better textures
4. Continued improvement on the surrounding vegetation
